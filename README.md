# PROJECT GUIDELINES 

## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
Develop a web application of your choice. It can be literally anything you like. The project is open-ended, with some specific requirements as outlined below.<br/> 
The project deliverable is the only deliverable for the whole semester SS2021. Your grade will depend on the following aspects: 
- Your project meets the logistical, technical and style requirements (see below)
- You’ve completed the project proposal on time (by May 18th) 
- You’ve completed your project on time (July 12th/ 13th)

## TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS
In your project, you **must** include the following technologies: 
**Frontend: HTML/CSS**
- Use classes and ids
- Use display: flex;
- Change 2+ default font properties
- Change 2+ box model properties (border, padding, margin) 
- Ensure responsive behavior for different screen sizes

**Frontend: JavaScript**<br/>
Object-oriented JavaScript
- Include at least 2 ES6 classes
- User at least one callback or Custom Event to communicate between classes<br/>

Events
- Listen for at least 2 events<br/>

API integration
- Use fetch() to communicate with a backend server<br/>

**Backend**
- Use Node and Express to create a backend server<br/>

  GET route
    - Create a GET route, which responds with data stored in a JSON file or responds by sending an image<br/>
  
  POST route
    - Create POST route, which includes a message body that updates a JSON file in the backend<br/>

## STYLE REQUIREMENTS
**All code must be documented sufficiently**<br/>

**HTML/CSS:** 
- Use tags semantically, e.g. don’t use <div> for every single element on your page.
- No deprecated tags.
- Use descendent selectors to reduce redundancy in CSS and HTML
- You must write raw HTML and CSS, as we have done all quarter.<br/>
  
**JavaScript:**
- Focus on writing object-oriented JavaScriptusing ES6 classes
- Avoid global variables.
    - OK to use globals for constants, instantiating classes, or other reasonable scenarios
    - But you should not put anything in a global variable that could be better encapsulated in a class
- Communicate between classes using callbacks or custom events.
- You must write Vanilla JavaScript.
- You may include 3rd party libraries as you wish 
  
## BONUS
Achieving some of the bonus tasks demonstrates that you are willing to explore on your own.
- Include a CSS animation or transition (not in the scope of class)(4 points)
- Deploy the backend application on Heroku via git. (You can keep the front-end local on your machine)(6 points)
- Use async/await somewhere in your project (either front-end or backend or both)(4 points)
- Instead of using a JSON file as a backend data store, use MongoDB(6 points)
  
## Project Ideas
You have 3 months to work on this project as you are learning all the elements to deliver. You will have at least 12h of dedicated time in class to work on the project (and if needed more). Here are some suggested guidelines on deciding what you want to build:<br/>

**Keep it simple and fun**
- The most important part of the delivering the project are the technical and style requirements.
- Stick to 3-5 screens at most
- If you recreate something that’s already out there, fine!
- Otherwise, you will not be graded on originality
  
## Submission
The final submission will be on github (instructions will be given in by April 19th)
  
## Grading
The final submission will be on github (instructions will be given in by April 19th)<br/>
You can receive a total of 100 points (50 points pass):
- Your submission will only count if the code runs (you can prove this in your demo). If your code does not work, it’s a fail. If your submission works (25 points)
- Meeting all technical requirements (40 points)
- Meeting all style requirements (30 points)
- If you get some of the bonus requirements done, you can receive up to 20 points (See bonus section)<br/>

Thus, you can achieve 95 points by meeting the standard requirements (1.3 grade).
